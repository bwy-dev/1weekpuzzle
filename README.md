# 1 Week Stealth Puzzle Game

This is the first game of my game a week task that I have set for myself. All things told it was a bit of a failure in terms of actual gameplay, however I learned a lot from the experience.

## How to play:

You play as a suspiciously mobile orange box (or the contents therein) , get to the green victory square without entering the line of site of the security guards! You can move to any adjacent panel by clicking on it, and wait a turn by clicking on the panel you currently occupy.
